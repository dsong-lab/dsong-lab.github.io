### About the DS Lab

Welcome to the DS lab at UConn Health! The DS Lab (**D**ata **S**cience or **D**ongyuan **S**ong) studies various data science problems in genomics. Our research focuses on developing novel computational tools for analyzing high-throughput "omics" data, especially for **single-cell** and **spatial** omics. By integrating statistical modeling, machine learning, and bioinformatics, the lab aims to provide a more rigorous interpretation of cellular variation from different biological systems.  

Some interesing questions include: (1) Generating *in silico* omics data from computers and using it as "synthetic" control data; (2) Modelling of co-expression behaviours across cells or spatial locations; (3) Data compression by gene selection, dimentionality reduction, and cell subsampling.
