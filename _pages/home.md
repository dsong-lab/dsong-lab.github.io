### About the DS Lab

The DS Lab (Dongyuan Song or Data Science) studies diverse data science problems in genomics. Our research focuses on developing novel computational tools for analyzing high-throughput "omics" data, especially for single-cell and spatial omics. By integrating statistical modeling, bioinformatics and machine learning, the lab aims to provide a more rigorous interpretation of biologcal signals from omics data. Some specific topics include: (1) generating realistic single-cell and spatial omics by computers; (2) Modelling of co-expression in spatial transcriptomics; (3) feature selection and cell subsampling.
