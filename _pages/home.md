### About the DS Lab

Welcome to the DS lab at UConn Health! We are looking for motivated **PhD students, Postdocs, and Undergraduate Interns** to join our team (see [Opennings](https://dsong-lab.github.io/openings/))!

The DS Lab (**D**ongyuan **S**ong or **D**ata **S**cience) studies various data science problems in genomics. Our research focuses on developing novel computational tools for analyzing high-throughput "omics" data, especially for **single-cell and spatial omics**. By integrating statistical modeling, machine learning, and bioinformatics, the lab aims to provide a more rigorous interpretation of cellular variation from different biological systems.  

In the past few years, our work has been puhclished on *Nature Biotechnology*, *Nature Communications*, *Genome Biology*, *Bioinformatics*, and other prestigious journals.

<!-- Some interesting questions in our lab include:
1. Creating Simulated Data: How can we use computers to generate fake omics data that looks like real experimental data?
2. Studying Gene Co-expression Patterns: How can we model how genes work together in different cell types or locations within a tissue?
3. Simplifying Data: How can we make large-scale omics datasets easier to work with by selecting key genes, dimentionality reduction, or analyzing fewer cells while still keeping important information? -->
