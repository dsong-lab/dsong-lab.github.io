We are recruting students and postodcs now! We are a "dry lab" that studies genomic data science with techniques in Bioinformatics, Statistics, and Machine Learning. Our lab is located in [Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences](https://health.uconn.edu/genetics/). If you have questions about any of the positions below, please email me for more information (<dosong@uchc.edu>).

### Ph.D. Students
#### Current students
Current students in [Ph.D. in Biomedical Science at UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/) are very welcome to rotate in our lab. If you are interested in computational genomics, please email me (<dosong@uchc.edu>) or stop by my office (R1151).  

Graduate students in Statistics/CS from UConn Storrs may also contact me for potential opportunities.

#### Perspective students
Perspective students should first apply to [Ph.D. in Biomedical Science at UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/). The application deadline is 12/01 every year. GRE is not required. For international applicants, the English exams requre TOEFL iBT >= 100 or IELTS >= 7.0. Perspective students who are interested in our lab can email me (<dosong@uchc.edu>) with "Ph.D. application: + YOUR NAME" as the subject line and include your CV.

### Undergraduate Students / Summer Interns
