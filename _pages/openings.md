We are currently recruiting students! The RT2 Lab is a computational research group focused on solving diverse problems in genomic data science, including statistical analysis, AI for Science, and bioinformatics. Our lab is part of the [Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences](https://health.uconn.edu/genetics/) at UConn Health.  

If you have any questions about available positions, please email me at <dosong@uchc.edu>.

### Ph.D. Students  

#### Current Students (at UCHC)
Students enrolled in the [Ph.D. Program in Biomedical Science at UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/) are encouraged to consider rotating in our lab. If you are interested in computational genomics, please reach out via email (<dosong@uchc.edu>) or stop by my office (R1151).  

We welcome students from diverse backgrounds. Please note that programming experience (in R and/or Python) is expected. I serve as faculty in two Areas of Concentration: [Genetics and Developmental Biology](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/genetics-and-developmental-biology-area-of-concentration/) (primary) and [Systems Biology](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/cell-analysis-and-modeling-graduate-program/).  

~~Graduate students in Statistics/Computer Science from UConn Storrs may also contact me for potential Graduate Assistantships.~~  
We currently have graduate students from UConn Storrs in the lab and no additional GA positions are available at this time.

#### Prospective Students (not at UCHC yet)
Prospective students should apply to the [Ph.D. Program in Biomedical Science at UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/). The application deadline is **December 1** each year. GRE scores are not required.  

For international applicants, the English proficiency requirements are TOEFL iBT ≥ 100 or IELTS ≥ 7.0.  

If you are interested in joining our lab, please email me (<dosong@uchc.edu>) with the subject line **"Ph.D. Application: [Your Name]"** and include your CV.

### Undergraduate Students / Summer Interns
If you are an *undergraduate student at UConn*, the [Health Research Program](https://ugradresearch.uconn.edu/hrp/) is an excellent opportunity to work with our lab. Please check their website every **February** for application details.

### Postdoctoral Researchers
Although we are not actively recruiting postdocs at the moment, we welcome inquiries from candidates who are interested in our research.

#### Postdoctoral Candidate Requirements
1. A Ph.D. in a quantitative discipline, such as Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Statistics, Computer Science, or Computational Biology.  
2. Proficiency in R and/or Python programming.  
3. Strong computational skills (e.g., statistical modeling, machine learning, artificial intelligence).  
4. Experience in genomics is preferred but not required.

#### Application Process
To apply, email me (<dosong@uchc.edu>) with the subject line **"Postdoc Application: [Your Name]"** and include the following:
- Your CV (including a list of references)
- A 1–2 page research statement  

Review of applications will begin immediately and will continue until the position is filled.
