We are recruting students now! We are a computational lab that studies various problems in genomic data science, such as statistical analysis, AI4Science, and bioinformatics. Our lab is located in [Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences](https://health.uconn.edu/genetics/). If you have questions about any of these positions, please email me for more information (<dosong@uchc.edu>).

### Ph.D. Students
#### Current students
Current students in [Ph.D. in Biomedical Science at UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/) are encouraged to rotate in our lab. If you are interested in computational genomics, please email me (<dosong@uchc.edu>) or stop by my office (R1151). We welcome students from diverse backgrounds. I serve on two Area of Concentrations: [Genetics and Developmental Biology](Primary)(https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/genetics-and-developmental-biology-area-of-concentration/) and [Systems Biology](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/cell-analysis-and-modeling-graduate-program/).

Graduate students in Statistics/CS from UConn Storrs may also contact me for potential Graduate Assistantships.

#### Perspective students
Perspective students should first apply to [Ph.D. in Biomedical Science at UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/). The application deadline is 12/01 every year. GRE is not required. For international applicants, the English exams requre TOEFL iBT >= 100 or IELTS >= 7.0. Perspective students who are interested in our lab can email me (<dosong@uchc.edu>) with "Ph.D. application: + YOUR NAME" as the subject line and include your CV.

### Undergraduate Students / Summer Interns
If you are an *undergraduate student at UConn*, [Health Research Program](https://ugradresearch.uconn.edu/hrp/) will be a wonderful opportunity for you. Please check their website every Feburary.

### Postdocs
Although we are not actively seeking postdocs at this time point, please feel free to contact me if you are interested in our research.

#### Requirements for the postdoc candidate
1. A Ph.D. in quantitative science, including but not limited to Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Statistics, Computer Sceince, and Computational Biology;
2. Proficient in R and/or Python programming;
3. Strong computational skills (e.g., statistical modeling, machine learning, artificial intelegence);
4. Experience in genomics is preferred but not requred.

#### Application
Please email me (<dosong@uchc.edu>) with "Postdoc application: + YOUR NAME" as the subject line and include your CV (including a list of references) and a research statement (1-2 pages). Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled.
