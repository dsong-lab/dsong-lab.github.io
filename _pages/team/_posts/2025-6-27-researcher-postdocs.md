I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences at UConn Health, working with Dr. Dongyuan Song. I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (Statistics) from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in May 2025. My research focuses on computational methods for single-cell and spatial omics data.
