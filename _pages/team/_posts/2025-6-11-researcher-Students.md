I am an undergraduate student at the University of Connecticut pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering with a concentration in Computational and Systems Biology. I am expected to graduate in 2026. I joined Dr. Songâ€™s lab as a HRP research assistant in May 2025 and work on a variety of modifications to the scDesign3 model.
