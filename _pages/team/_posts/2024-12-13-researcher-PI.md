Hi, I am Dongyuan Song (宋东源), a tenure-track Assistant Professor in [Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, University of Connecticut, Health Center (UConn Health)](https://health.uconn.edu/genetics/). Before joining UConn Health in November 2024, I finished my PhD training in statistical genomics with [Jingyi Jessica Li](http://jsb.ucla.edu/) at UCLA. I did my undergraduate research in evolutionary biology with Baorong Lu at Fudan and master research in bioinformatics with [Rafael Irizarry](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. My research focuses on developing computational methods for analyzing modern "omics" data, especially for **single-cell and spatial omics**. In recent years, I have publised a series of bioinformatic tools: [scDesign3 (Nature Biotechnology, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-01772-1), [scReadSim (Nature Communications, 2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43162-w), [scSampler (Bioinformatics, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac271), [scGTM (Bioinformatics, 2022)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/16/3927/6618524), [scDesign2 (Genome Biology, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02367-2), [PseudotimeDE (Genome Biology, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02341-y), [scPNMF (Bioinformatics, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab273).
