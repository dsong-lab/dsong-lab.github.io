I'm currently working as a research assistant in Dr. Song’s lab. I have a background in statistical genetics and computational biology, with research interests in single-cell transcriptomics, complex trait genetics, and rare diseases. I’m motivated by the potential of computational approaches to reveal biological insights and support disease research.
