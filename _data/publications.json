		"abstract": "Summary: Identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes along cell pseudotime is crucial for understanding dynamic biological processes captured by single-cell RNA sequencing. However, existing DE methods either produce invalid P-values by ignoring the uncertainty in pseudotime inference or struggle to scale with the growing size of modern datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce PseudotimeDE-fast, a scalable method for detecting DE genes along pseudotime with well-calibrated P-values. Through comprehensive simulations and real-data analyses, we demonstrate that PseudotimeDE-fast delivers comparable or superior performance to existing approaches while offering substantial improvements in computational efficiency.",

		"abstract": "Background: Spatially resolved transcriptomics offers unprecedented insight by enabling the profiling of gene expression within the intact spatial context of cells, effectively adding a new and essential dimension to data interpretation. To efficiently detect spatial structure of interest, an essential step in analyzing such data involves identifying spatially variable genes (SVGs). Despite researchers having developed several computational methods to accomplish this task, the lack of a comprehensive benchmark evaluating their performance remains a considerable gap in the field.\nResults: Here, we systematically evaluate 14 methods using 96 spatial datasets and 6 metrics. We compare the methods regarding gene ranking and classification based on real spatial variation, statistical calibration, and computation scalability and investigate the impact of identified SVGs on downstream applications such as spatial domain detection. Finally, we explore the applicability of the methods to spatial ATAC-seq data to examine their effectiveness in identifying spatially variable peaks (SVPs). Overall, SPARK-X outperforms other benchmarked methods and Moran’s I achieves a competitive performance, representing a strong baseline for future method development. Moreover, our results reveal that most methods are poorly calibrated, and more specialized algorithms are needed to identify spatially variable peaks.\nConclusions: Our benchmarking provides a detailed comparison of SVG detection methods and serves as a reference for both users and method developers.",

		"abstract": "The transcriptome provides a highly informative molecular phenotype to connect genotype to phenotype and is most frequently measured by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Therefore, an ultimate goal is to perturb every gene and measure changes in the transcriptome. However, this remains challenging, especially in intact organisms due to different experimental and computational challenges. Here, we present ‘Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS)’, which provides high-resolution RNA-seq profiles for hundreds of replicate perturbations at a time in a living animal. WPS introduces multiple experimental advances that combine strengths of bulk and single cell RNA-seq, and that further provides an analytical framework, EmpirDE, that leverages the unique power of the large WPS datasets. EmpirDE identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by using gene-specific empirical null distributions, rather than control conditions alone, thereby systematically removing technical biases and improving statistical rigor. We applied WPS to 103\n            Caenhorhabditis elegans\n            nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) to delineate a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) and found that this GRN presents a striking ‘pairwise modularity’ where pairs of NHRs regulate shared target genes. We envision that the experimental and analytical advances of WPS should be useful not only for\n            C. elegans\n            , but will be broadly applicable to other models, including human cells.",

Despite numerous structural studies and large-scale analyses of HD DNA binding specificity, HD-DNA recognition is still not fully understood. Here, we analyze 92 human HD mutants, including disease-associated variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS), for their effects on DNA binding activity. Many of the variants alter DNA binding affinity and/or specificity. Detailed biochemical analysis and structural modeling identifies 14 previously unknown specificity-determining positions, 5 of which do not contact DNA. The same missense substitution at analogous positions within different HDs often exhibits different effects on DNA binding activity. Variant effect prediction tools perform moderately well in distinguishing variants with altered DNA binding affinity, but poorly in identifying those with altered binding specificity. Our results highlight the need for biochemical assays of TF coding variants and prioritize dozens of variants for further investigations into their pathogenicity and the development of clinical diagnostics and precision therapies.",

To fill this gap, we introduce scReadSim, a single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq read simulator that allows user-specified ground truths and generates synthetic sequencing reads (in a FASTQ or BAM file) by mimicking real data. At both read-sequence and read-count levels, scReadSim mimics real scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. Moreover, scReadSim provides ground truths, including unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts for scRNA-seq and open chromatin regions for scATAC-seq. In particular, scReadSim allows users to design cell-type-specific ground-truth open chromatin regions for scATAC-seq data generation. In benchmark applications of scReadSim, we show that UMI-tools achieves the top accuracy in scRNA-seq UMI deduplication, and HMMRATAC and MACS3 achieve the top performance in scATAC-seq peak calling.",

Since model interpretability and flexibility are both indispensable for understanding biological processes, the single-cell field needs a model that improves the interpretability and largely maintains the flexibility of nonparametric regression models.Here, we propose the single-cell generalized trend model (scGTM) for capturing a gene\u2019s expression trend, which may be monotone, hill-shaped or valley-shaped, along cell pseudotime. The scGTM has three advantages: (i) it can capture non-monotonic trends that are easy to interpret, (ii) its parameters are biologically interpretable and trend informative, and (iii) it can flexibly accommodate common distributions for modeling gene expression counts. To tackle the complex optimization problems, we use the particle swarm optimization algorithm to find the constrained maximum likelihood estimates for the scGTM parameters. As an application, we analyze several single-cell gene expression datasets using the scGTM and show that scGTM can capture interpretable gene expression trends along cell pseudotime and reveal molecular insights underlying biological processes.The Python package scGTM is open-access and available at https://github.com/ElvisCuiHan/scGTM.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

For such large-scale data, subsampling is a powerful and often necessary tool for exploratory data analysis.

Therefore, diversity-preserving subsampling is required for fast exploration of cell types in a large-scale dataset. Here, we propose scSampler, an algorithm for fast diversity-preserving subsampling of single-cell transcriptomic data.scSampler is implemented in Python and is published under the MIT source license.

        "abstract":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) captures whole transcriptome information of individual cells. While scRNA-seq measures thousands of genes, researchers are often interested in only dozens to hundreds of genes for a closer study. Then, a question is how to select those informative genes from scRNA-seq data. Moreover, single-cell targeted gene profiling technologies are gaining popularity for their low costs, high sensitivity and extra (e.g. spatial) information; however, they typically can only measure up to a few hundred genes. Then another challenging question is how to select genes for targeted gene profiling based on existing scRNA-seq data.Here, we develop the single-cell Projective Non-negative Matrix Factorization (scPNMF) method to select informative genes from scRNA-seq data in an unsupervised way. Compared with existing gene selection methods, scPNMF has two advantages. First, its selected informative genes can better distinguish cell types. Second, it enables the alignment of new targeted gene profiling data with reference data in a low-dimensional space to facilitate the prediction of cell types in the new data. Technically, scPNMF modifies the PNMF algorithm for gene selection by changing the initialization and adding a basis selection step, which selects informative bases to distinguish cell types. We demonstrate that scPNMF outperforms the state-of-the-art gene selection methods on diverse scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, we show that scPNMF can guide the design of targeted gene profiling experiments and the cell-type annotation on targeted gene profiling data.The R package is open-access and available at https://github.com/JSB-UCLA/scPNMF.

        "abstract":"To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying cell state changes, a crucial analysis is to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes along the pseudotime inferred from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. However, existing methods do not account for pseudotime inference uncertainty, and they have either ill-posed p-values or restrictive models. Here we propose PseudotimeDE, a DE gene identification method that adapts to various pseudotime inference methods, accounts for pseudotime inference uncertainty, and outputs well-calibrated p-values. Comprehensive simulations and real-data applications verify that PseudotimeDE outperforms existing methods in false discovery rate control and power.",

        "abstract":"For most marine organisms, species richness peaks in the Central Indo-Pacific region and declines longitudinally, a striking pattern that remains poorly understood. Here, we used phylogenetic approaches to address the causes of richness patterns among global marine regions, comparing the relative importance of colonization time, number of colonization events, and diversification rates (speciation minus extinction). We estimated regional richness using distributional data for almost all percomorph fishes (17 435 species total, including approximately 72% of all marine fishes and approximately 33% of all freshwater fishes). The high diversity of the Central Indo-Pacific was explained by its colonization by many lineages 5.3\u201334 million years ago. These relatively old colonizations allowed more time for richness to build up through in situ diversification compared to other warm-marine regions. Surprisingly, diversification rates were decoupled from marine richness patterns, with clades in low-richness cold-marine habitats having the highest rates. Unlike marine richness, freshwater diversity was largely derived from a few ancient colonizations, coupled with high diversification rates. Our results are congruent with the geological history of the marine tropics, and thus may apply to many other organisms. Beyond marine biogeography, we add to the growing number of cases where colonization and time-for-speciation explain large-scale richness patterns instead of diversification rates.",

        "abstract":"Abstract Substantial genetic variation is found in weedy rice (Oryza sativa f. spontanea Roshev.) populations from different rice-planting regions with the change of farming styles. To determine the association of such genetic variation with rice farming changes is critical for understanding the adaptive evolution of weedy rice. We studied weedy-rice specific novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by genome-wide comparison between DNA sequences of weedy and cultivated rice, in addition to polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting at 22 selected novel SNP loci in weedy rice populations. A great number of novel SNPs were identified across the weedy rice genome. High frequencies of the novel SNPs were determined at the 22 selected loci, although with considerable variation among weedy rice populations in different rice-planting regions. The highest frequency (~57%) of novel SNPs was identified in weedy rice populations from Jiangsu that experienced the most dramatic changes in rice farming styles, including the shift from transplanting to direct seeding, and from indica to japonica varieties. The lowest frequency (~29%) was detected in weedy rice populations from Northeast China, where rice farming has undergone relatively less change. The association between frequencies of novel SNPs in weedy rice populations and the extent of changes in rice farming styles suggests the critical role of adaptive mutation and accumulation of the mutation influenced by human activities in the rapid evolution of weedy rice.",
